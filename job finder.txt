Job Finder

Idea: Unemployment is an issue that exists so job finder is meant to help with that issue. If someone is looking for a job, wether it be a part time job, summer job or a full time job they could find it here. If a company
were looking for employees for whatever reason they could open the app and put up a job request, which would show what job or jobs are being asked for, how many people, what skills that person or people need,
the location, work time etc. Once it is done it will be put up on a board of sorts where people can scroll through and look at jobs. If someone finds a job they want or they think they can do, they can apply for it.
When applying a notification will be sent to the person who put up the job.
